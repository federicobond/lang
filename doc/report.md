Primer
======

## Introduction

This document describes the design of the Primer language. Primer is an imperative
language for the [Java Virtual Machine][jvm] (from now on, the JVM). It has a
clean syntax inspired by languages like [Scala][scala] and [Kotlin][kotlin],
but does not support object-oriented programming.

## Design Considerations

The initial AST class design was heavily inspired by the [JRuby][jruby] project.

## Grammar description


## Difficulties encountered

One of the first difficulties we found was configuring everything correctly. The
[JFlex][jflex] and [Java CUP][java_cup] projects are quite old and while they
have received constant updates, the documentation is lacking in several areas,
with many obsolete code examples.

The other main obstacle was coming up with a suitable workflow for adding new
language features. Writing integration tests early on made it possible to work
on the codebase with confidence that we would not break any previous
functionality.

## Preliminary research

After some research we found out that the [Jasmin][jasmin] library suggested in
class was not the best choice for implementing the language, since it was no
longer maintained and lacked useful abstraction for generating the required
bytecode from the Abstract Syntax Tree. We decided to use the widely known
[ASM][asm] library, which proved to be a valuable inclusion in the project.

## Supporting libraries

The project was very conservative in its use of libraries. For generating the
lexer and parser code we used [JFlex][jflex] and [Java CUP][java_cup].

To generate bytecode from the AST returned by the parser, we chose the
[ASM][asm] library.

We also relied on Google's [Guava][guava] libraries for some helper methods.

## Notes on the workflow

We found a very useful workflow for adding the bytecode implementations for
each node. We would write a Java implementation of the syntax construct we were
implementing and look at the generated bytecode (the IntelliJ IDEA IDE has a
very useful bytecode view that is accessed from the View menu). The one thing
that we had to be careful for was to keep the JVM from optimizing constant
expressions. In most cases, assigning the expression components to variables is
enough to prevent this. So, instead of writing:

    if (true && false) {
        ...
    }

We would write:

    boolean a = true;
    boolean b = false;
    if (a && b) {
        ...
    }

The Java bytecode instruction listings found in Wikipedia also proved very
useful, since it details the contents of the stack before and after every
instruction.

# Optimization passes

We designed an optimization pass that traverses the AST and simplifies nodes
based on compile-time folding of constant expressions. It also handles `if`
statements whose condition can be determined to be always true. The optimization
pass also discards any `else` clauses and replaces the `if` node with a block.
Thus, the compiled code will not contain any unnecessary jumps.

The code for this optimization can be found in the `ConstantFoldingVisitor`
class.

## Benchmarking

We compared primer code against equivalent Java and Ruby implementations of
the fibonacci function. The results are listed in the table below.

### `Fibonacci.java`

    public class Fibonacci {

      private static int fibonacci(int n) {
          if (n < 2) {
              return n;
          }
          return fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2);
      }

      public static void main(String[] args) {
          System.out.println(fibonacci(30));
      }
    }

### `fibonacci.ruby`

    def fibonacci(n)
      if n < 2
        return n
      end
      return fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2)
    end

    puts fibonacci(32)

### `fibonacci.primer`

    def fibonacci(n) {
      if n < 2 {
        return n
      }
      return fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2)
    }

    println(fibonacci(32))

### Results

  Language     Average run time\*  Tokens
  ---------- -------------------- -------
  Java                     0.17 s      60
  Ruby                     0.69 s      32
  Primer\*\*               0.39 s      36

\* Average of ten invocations using the `time` UNIX command. Tested on a
MacBook Pro 2.4 GHz (mid 2010)

\*\* Includes compilation time.

We can see from the table above that Primer achieves a performance between
that of Java and Ruby, but with a conciseness much closer to the last one.

Since Primer compiles to JVM bytecode, there is ample room for optimization,
and a [Sufficiently Smart Compiler](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?SufficientlySmartCompiler)
could generate code that runs as fast as equivalent code written in Java.

## Future extensions

Thorough the project we kept a `TODO.md` file with ideas for things we could
add to the language. Some of them landed on the final release, but others
demanded too much time and are listed below as future extensions.

### Lazy boolean operators

Contrary to the behavior of many languages, report does not support lazy
boolean operators, and has to evaluate both sides of each expression every
time. To fix it, we need to revise the bytecode generator so that it outputs
correct jump instructions for these cases.

Estimated time to implement: one day.

###Â Java interoperability

The main obstacle for achieving Java interoperability was the ability to
handle and express the full range of types in Java. Projects such as Jython or
JRuby managed to run Java code from a dynamically typed context, but
this requires some non-trivial type handling.

Estimated time to implement: one week.

### Literals for commonly used objects

While calling constructors such as `list()` is an acceptable solution, most
modern languages include some syntax for describing lists, maps, ranges and
regexes. Example notation could be:

    var list = [1, 2, 3]
    var map = { "foo": 1, "bar": 2 }
    var range = 1..10
    var regex = /[^abc]*/

Estimated time to implement: 3 days.

### List and map indexing syntax

Currently, we use the `list_get` and `hash_get` functions for accessing
list and map elements. A more elegant solution involves the use of `[]`
syntax for performing this task.

    list
    # => [1, 2, 3]
    list[1]
    # => 2

    hash
    # => { "foo": 1, "bar": 2 }
    hash["foo"]
    # => 1

Estimated time to implement: 1 day.

### Lambda expressions

Being able to manipulate functions as regular objects has proved to be a
powerful programming technique. Many modern languages have adopted some
of support for this kind of programming. Implementing such a system is
anything from trivial, especially in a platform like the JVM. Fortunately
there is a surge in [documentation][java-lambdas] on this topic because of the inclusion
of lambdas in Java 8.

    var lambda = (n) -> 2 * n
    var list = [1, 2, 3]
    list_map(list, lambda)
    # => [4, 5, 6]

Estimated time to implement: one month.

## Conclusion

We found out that implementing a programming language on top of the JVM is both approachable and fun.
The supporting libraries are mature and provide useful abstractions for simplifying the work.

We learned about JVM internals that are rarely exposed most Java programmer and gained a better
understanding of the Java platform.
